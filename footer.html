                <p>Hello, I am a Civil Engineer
                    with over 6 years of experience
                    in market development and sales.
                    My diverse background includes
                    international experience, having
                    worked for six months in Australia.
                    My passion for continuous improvement
                    drives me to learn new skills, including
                    proficiency in HTML and CSS, and refine
                    my existing expertise. I'm always looking
                    for opportunities to innovate and grow
                    professionally and personally. Let's connect
                    to discuss potential collaborations or
                    opportunities within the industry.
